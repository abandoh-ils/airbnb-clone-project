# Database Design
+ Users
  + user_id (Primary Key)
  + username
  + email
  + password_hash
  + registration_date
- Relationship: A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings. Users can also leave multiple reviews.

+ Properties
  + property_id (Primary Key)
  + host_id (Foreign Key to Users)
  + title
  + description
  + location
  + price_per_night
- Relationship: Each property belongs to one user (host). A property can have multiple bookings and multiple reviews.

+ Bookings
  + booking_id (Primary Key)
  + user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
  + property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)
  + check_in_date
  + check_out_date
  + total_price
- Relationship: A booking is made by a user for a specific property. Each booking is associated with a payment.

+ Payments
  + payment_id (Primary Key)
  + booking_id (Foreign Key to Bookings)
  + amount
  + payment_date
  + status
- Relationship: Each payment is directly linked to a specific booking.

+ Reviews
  + review_id (Primary Key)
  + user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
  + property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)
  + rating
  + comment
  + review_date
- Relationship: A review is left by a user for a specific property.

# Feature Breakdown
+ User Management: This feature allows for secure user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures that users can create accounts, log in, and manage their personal information within the application.
+ Property Management: This functionality enables users to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. It is crucial for hosts to manage their accommodations and for guests to browse available properties.
Booking System: This feature facilitates the reservation of properties and the management of booking details, including check-in and check-out dates. It is essential for users to book stays and for hosts to manage their reservations.
+ Payment Processing: This system handles financial transactions related to bookings. It ensures secure and efficient processing of payments, recording all necessary payment details.
+ Review System: This feature allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. It provides valuable feedback for both hosts and future guests, contributing to the platform's trustworthiness.
+ Data Optimization: This involves implementing indexing and caching strategies to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage. It is vital for improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the backend system.
+ API Documentation: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI Standard, ensuring clarity and ease of integration. This provides developers with clear guidelines for interacting with the backend services.

# API Security
Ensuring the security of the API is paramount for protecting sensitive user data, maintaining system integrity, and fostering trust. The following key security measures will be implemented:

+ Authentication: This process verifies the identity of users and applications attempting to access the API. It is crucial for protecting user data (e.g., personal profiles, booking history) and ensuring that only legitimate users can access their information. Without strong authentication, unauthorized parties could potentially impersonate users and gain access to sensitive data.
+ Authorization: Once a user or application is authenticated, authorization determines what specific resources or actions they are permitted to access. This is vital for securing various aspects of the project:
  + User Data: Ensures users can only view and modify their own profiles and bookings, not those of others.
  + Property Management: Guarantees that only property owners can modify their listings.
  + Payment Processing: Restricts payment-related operations to authorized entities, preventing fraudulent transactions.
  + System Integrity: Prevents unauthorized modifications to critical system data.
+ Rate Limiting: This mechanism controls the number of API requests a user or client can make within a specified timeframe. Rate limiting is essential for preventing abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-force login attempts, or excessive data scraping. By limiting requests, it helps maintain the stability and availability of the API, protecting the overall performance of the platform.

These measures collectively contribute to a robust security posture, safeguarding against unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions across all key areas of the Airbnb Clone project.
